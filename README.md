# PCA_on_Yield_Curve

The project aims to analyze and investigate changes in the 1990-2021 US yield curve through the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
By utilizing PCA, a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, we can uncover the underlying patterns and dominant factors driving the variations in the yield curve.

# Introduction
Upon conducting the PCA, we discovered that the first three principal components accounted for over 90 percent of the total variance in the dataset. 
This finding suggests that these components capture the most significant sources of variation within the yield curve, enabling us to gain valuable insights into its behavior.

Importantly, the first three components identified in our project align with those observed in previous studies exploring similar topics. 
This consistency across multiple projects enhances the robustness and reliability of our findings, validating the relevance of our analysis and reinforcing the credibility of our results.

Notably, our research revealed an interesting distinction between the behavior of the first principal component before and after the 2008 financial crisis. 
Prior to the crisis, a parallel shift in the yield curve was a common occurrence, where all maturities experienced uniform changes. 
However, in the aftermath of the crisis, we observed a notable shift in the behavior of the first principal component.

Following the crisis, the short-term interest rate appeared to stabilize, while the mid and long-term rates often exhibited a parallel shift. 
This discrepancy implies that the dynamics driving the yield curve changed significantly in the post-2008 period compared to the pre-crisis era. 
Such a finding holds important implications for understanding the evolving nature of the financial markets and the impact of major economic events.

The actions taken by the Federal Reserve, particularly in terms of determining the short-term interest rate, played a crucial role in shaping the post-crisis yield curve dynamics. 
With the Federal Reserve keeping the policy rate close to zero for an extended period following the 2008 crisis, market participants held varying expectations regarding the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes. 
This discrepancy in expectations drove the observed shift primarily in the mid and long-term rates, while the short-term rate remained relatively stable due to the Federal Reserve's policy actions. 
Hence, our findings highlight the impact of the post-2008 crisis monetary policy on the behavior of the US yield curve.

Overall, our project's application of Principal Component Analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of the US yield curve between 1990 and 2021. 
By identifying the dominant components and their changing patterns over time, we contribute to the existing body of knowledge and deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics within the financial markets.
